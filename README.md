# myAsenso Backend API

- This repo is intended for the backend side of our fullstack capstone project under Kodego's curriculum. There are a LOT of drawbacks during the development of this project, which I will not mention here. I'm hoping to accomplish the entirety of this portion within our development window, and present the whole project succesfully along with my group.
- Utilized EJS templating during backend development. It will eventually be omitted once merged with frontend to give way to React.
