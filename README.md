# myAsensoâ„¢ Backend API

- Utilized EJS templating during backend development. It will eventually be omitted once merged with frontend to give way to React.
- This repo is intended for the backend side of our fullstack capstone project under Kodego's curriculum. Privately, I've been through a LOT of drawbacks during the development of this project. I'm hoping to accomplish the entirety of this portion within our development window, and present the whole project succesfully along with my group.
